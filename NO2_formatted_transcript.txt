you have to get rid of fluoride bifluoride free toothpaste get rid of fluoride in 
your drinking water and your home health system or home water system and then if 
you're using an acid you have to stop for people who are unfamiliar with nitric 
oxide what is it and what role does it play in the body well I 
think it's been maybe a couple years since we last spoke well not last spoke 
since we're on the podcast I've seen it several conferences yeah but yeah nitric oxide 


is one of these fascinating molecules it's a gas it's produced naturally in the human 
body the older we get the less we make and that's what's responsible for age-related 
disease but it's it's and you call it it's a signaling molecule it tells cells 
in the body communicate it's most common or known function is in vasodilation so it's 
produced by the lining of the blood vessels it diffuses into the smooth muscle where 
it leads to smooth muscle relaxation vasodilation so it controls blood flow and circulation to 


every organ tissue and cell in the body and when we lose the regulation of 
blood flow bad things happen as the earliest event in chronic disease wow and it 
plays a role in all kinds of chronic disease conditions right like type 2 diabetes 
hypertension even I mean I'm guessing Dimension Alzheimer's disease where vascular dysfunction plays a role 
for sure so if you look kind of broadly and I've been in academic medicine 
now for 25 years and so we understand the scientific Community understands what causes human 


disease we know how to diagnose it we know how to fix it so the 
fact that we don't have a treatment for Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease to me is 
unacceptable so the problem is not that we don't know the science it's that we 
can't we haven't been able to communicate the science to the healthcare practitioners Physicians and 
then teach them how to teach their patients so when we look at chronic disease 
there's four Hallmarks of every single chronic disease doesn't matter if it's Alzheimer's cardiovascular disease 


diabetes autoimmune disease what is that there's decreased blood flow to the organ there's inflammation 
oxidative stress and immune dysfunction and nitric oxide is what controls and mitigates all four 
of those it improves blood flow some of my patterns on methods of reducing inflammation 
we know we shut out down the fires of inflammation it prevents oxidative stress and 
it mitigates the immune dysfunction that's occurring in those disease tissues so it's really the 
Holy Grail in terms of cardiovascular medicine but when we look at kind of the 


first so there's a hierarchy of symptoms right when you start to develop nitric oxide 
deficiency the first sign and symptom is usually erectile dysfunction and that makes sense because 
when you lose the ability to dilate blood vessels which you need to dilate the 
sex organs to get engorgement to get an erection in both men and women when 
you lose the ability to produce nitric oxide you lose you fail to get vasodilation 
you don't get engorgement and it's the fundamental basis for erectile dysfunction so if you 


have Ed that's not just a sexual dysfunction it's what we call the canary in 
the coal mine wow if you have vascular dysfunction in the sex organs you have 
asker dysfunction in the heart the brain the liver the kidneys it's a systemic disease 
so if you don't recognize that as a really serious sign and symptom and take 
steps to correct it you're now on a very slippery slope to cardiovascular disease the 
number one killer of men and women insulin resistance vascular dementia Alzheimer's every single age-related 


chronic disease can be traced back to lack of nitric oxide wow so it is 
like erectile dysfunction is like the major red flag are there others yeah typically then 
if you have it if your blood pressure starts to creep up you know Nitric 
one of the Nitric oxide's fundamental roles in regulation of acetone keeping your blood vessels 
soft and compliant and being able to dilate upon need and so when you lose 
the ability to make nitric oxide that's the primary vasodilator so the vessels become chronically 


constricted you're now pumping the same volume of blood through a thinner hose wow so 
you develop high blood pressure and then that leads to damage of the blood vessels 
which leads to plaque deposition atherosclerosis heart attack and stroke so then then and two 
out of three Americans have an unsafe elevation in blood pressure so it's a huge 
problem it's the number one risk factor for the number one killer of men and 
women worldwide which is cardiac disease and then you mentioned one that's near and dear 


to your heart is dementia and Alzheimer's and we know fundamentally what causes Dimension Alzheimer's 
it's lack of cerebral blood flow and it's insulin resistance it's in fact by many 
referred to as type 3 diabetes and so what does nitric oxide do it dilates 
the blood vessels we can perfuse the brain and it improves insulin signaling potentiates glucose 
uptake and we reverse the entire metabolic phenotype of Dimension Alzheimer's wow and in fact 
we have a drug now and going into clinical trials specifically for Alzheimer's that's incredible 


erectile dysfunction is something that just just going back to that for a minute it's 
something that is fairly obvious to observe if you're a male right but what about 
in in women because heart disease is still the number one killer in women and 
women are at twice the risk of developing Alzheimer's as compared to men so what 
is like one of those early red flags that women could look out for well 
I think it's the same thing when you look at sexual function in in women 


in order for women to become aroused and stimulated and have an orgasm you have 
to have an increase in blood flow and that leads to an increase in interlabial 
pressure Intercultural pressure and that's what leads to orgasm so all of that increase in 
pressure is due to vasodilation from nitric oxide wow you can't make nitric oxide you 
don't get dilation you don't get the increased pressure women become an orgasmic and they 
develop sexual dysfunction but so those and and women you know men are somewhat simple 


creatures it's typically just a vascular problem in women it's it's hormonal it's psychological it's 
it's vascular it's physiological there are a number of different contributing factors but it's still 
the underlying problem is the vascular dysfunction you can do hormone replacement therapy but if 
you don't fix nitric oxide production in the lining of the blood vessels then you're 
only correcting half the problem wow so what are the primary causes then of this 
decline in nitric oxide you know we've spent one of the fundamental questions I've asked 


in my research lab for the past 25 years is how does the human body 
make nitric oxide What goes wrong in people that can't make it what are the 
clinical consequences then how do we fix it so in order to answer the second 
question is what goes wrong and people can't make it we have to understand how 
the human body normally makes it there are two primary Pathways there's an enzyme in 
the lining of the blood vessels that makes nitric oxide they're very complex it's called 


a five electron oxidation of L-Arginine which is in the semi-essential amino acid so that 
enzyme becomes dysfunctional with age and time there's some genetic predispositions that cause it to 
become dysfunctional but a lot of it is due to diet and lifestyle you know 
poor diet sedentary lifestyle render that enzyme dysfunction so we know how to correct that 
we know how to recouple the enzyme and restore the function what's the name of 
the enzyme it's called nitric oxide synthase so it's found in the lining of the 


blood vessels it's found in our immune cells and it's found in neurons wow so 
it's part of the neuro signaling and the action potentials by neurons and the cell 
signaling is called a presynaptic or a retrograde messenger it's how these neurons talk to 
one another can we also have it like RNR sinuses enriched with nitric oxide synthase 
so there's there's a high concentration of this enzyme in our epithelial cells in fact 
it's the basis for blood pressure lowering effects of deep breathing wow so mouth breathers 


bypass this that's one of the reasons by mouth breathing is so detrimental because you're 
bypassing a fundamental nitric oxide production Cascade wow but if you have a dysfunctional enzyme 
in the endothelial cells then that enzyme is dysfunctional on the epithelial cells so you 
can do nasal breathing or debriefing exercise but if we don't fix that enzyme and 
make it functional you're not going to get any nitric oxide produced when you do 
breathing exercise so that's what people have failed to recognize is what's the enzymopathy in 


that enzyme and then how do you fix it because that's that's really the Holy 
Grail in cardiovascular medicine and then so that's one way we become nitric oxide deficient 
the other is kind of the aha moment for most people because about 20 years 
ago we recognized that there's an enterocellular circuit right so the mechanism of action of 
certain dietary patterns whether it's a plant-based diet or Japanese diet or Mediterranean diet we're 
consuming a lot of inorganic nitrate and then this molecule is inert in humans so 


humans cannot process this molecule we're 100 dependent upon the bacteria so there's bacteria on 
the crypts of the tongue that metabolize nitrate into nitride and nitric oxide so if 
you don't have the right oral microbiome you can consume these vegetables but you don't 
get the nitric oxide benefits of it and here's where the problem comes in mouthwash 
two out of three Americans use mouthwash two out of three American seven unsafe elevation 
blood pressure and we published I think in 2015 that this is causal for hypertension 


so when you eradicate these essential commensal nitrate reducing bacteria it causes an increase in 
blood pressure the other problem is fluoride fluoride is an antiseptic kills the bacteria most 
people put fluoride in their toothpaste or using fluorinated toothpaste there's fluoride and Municipal Water 
fluoride is an antiseptic it's a neurotoxin and it kills your thyroid function yikes so 
we have to get rid of fluoride yeah I mean it is a serious toxin 
dude you are the one who turned me on to this whole mouthwash thing and 


I had the privilege of getting to go on The Joe Rogan podcast and and 
talk about it because I mean since you since you brought it up on my 
podcast I mean it's a rabbit hole that I was happy to go down because 
it's just so fascinating so just make it like if you can I mean you've 
already made it so clear but just walk us through this again how can mouthwash 
something as benign right it's sold over the counter right can does over-the-counter mouthwash have 


this have this effect absolutely so here's what happens and the advertisements are correct kills 
99.99 the bacteria when you use it and that's the problem that's the problem I 
mean the bacteria that live in and on the human body outnumber on human cells 
ten to one right so this is an entire ecology we call this symbiosis these 
bacteria providing metabolic benefits to the human host that we can't do one of those 
is production of nitric oxide so when you eradicate these bacteria there's an entire ecology 


from the mouth all the way down to the anus right then it's the microbiome 
a lot of people focused on the gut microbiome years ago we focused on the 
oral microbiome and what we found was that the more diverse the microbiome the better 
cardiovascular health and the better blood pressure management so when you eradicate this with mouthwash 
we saw I think the first paper was in maybe 2009 2010 you take normal 
tens of patients you just put them on mouthwash twice a day for seven days 


you see an increase in blood pressure damn now this was an this drove kind 
of cardiologist in in vascular biology is crazy because they thought we we thought we 
had a pretty good understanding of vascular biology and maintenance of stomach blood pressure so 
how by killing oral bacteria we're affecting systemic blood pressure and Vascular tone and then 
we figured out well it's through the production of nitric oxide so yeah alcohol-based mouthwash 
does this the chlorhexidine prescription mouthwash is very effective at killing it the good news 


is and we published this in 2019. if you use mouthwash we certainly see an 
increase in blood pressure and I think in 2020 I was on The Doctors show 
we came in we revealed that if you use mouthwash you actually lose the protective 
benefits of exercise so think about this if you're trying to do all the right 
things you're eating a good balanced diet you're getting exercise but if you're using mouthwash 
you lose the entire cardiovascular benefits of everything you're doing the good news is four 


days after we stop using it blood pressure normalizes the bacteria we completely repopulate so 
this is a resilient community that just let them do their job leave them alone 
you know there's a reason we don't take an oral antibiotic every day for the 
rest of our life there's known systemic effects of this right so it doesn't make 
any sense to use an oral antiseptic every day for the rest of our life 
yet two-thirds of Americans wake up every morning and use mouthwash shocking and so to 


me it's no wonder why Americans are the sickest population on the planet but they 
they'll sometimes Market these mouthwash mouthwashes for for people with diabetes right like they'll but 
but it that seems to be misguided it's counter-intuitive yeah and misguided and yeah making 
it worse as you suggested if nitric oxide plays a role in insulin signaling right 
we'll have to look back and think about historically what caused this right what caused 
medicine to do the things they're doing today and most of the time there was 


good reason right so 50 60 years ago there was a recognition of an oral 
systemic link right that patients who have periodontal disease gingivitis have a higher incidence of 
heart attack and stroke so they immediately assumed that it was the pathogens in the 
gum that translocated got systemic cause of vascular inflammation plaque instability plaque rupture heart attack 
and stroke so then the thought was well if that's the case then we need 
to kill these bugs kill the pathogens but that was long before we understood the 


entire microbiome so when I asked Dennis this all the time and I speak a 
lot of dental events why do you still use fluoride rinses and why you still 
prescribing chlorhexidine or mouthwash to your patients thinking well that's just the way we've always 
done it well you know when medicine you know years ago we used to use 
leeches for exsanguination right we don't do that anymore because we have better methods and 
we know the science the science advances so we have to be able to apply 


the Innovations in basic science and translate that into clinical medicine and the only way 
to do that is to take this new information pivot realize that okay maybe what 
we weren't doing was working because people aren't getting better going to Physicians and taking 
medicine in fact they're getting worse hmm and from a scientific standpoint we understand the 
mechanism of disease today that we can fix every single chronic disease while also like 
medicine is known for taking this reductionist approach where the where the different organ systems 


of the body are siled off and studied unto themselves but if there's anything that 
that the microbiome has shown us is that everything is connected yeah the knee bones 
connect to the hip bone yeah Hearts connected to the mouth to the lungs to 
the sex organs I mean we're all connected through the cardiovascular system and when that 
fun when that fails then you get end organ disease and the human body fails 
so what happens then when we eat uh uh meal or a dish a bowl 


of dark leafy greens for example rich in these inorganic nitrates like what favorite what 
favorite kale oh my God people always pick on me for I enjoy killing is 
that the only dark leafy green that I like I like arugula I like the 
mixed organic greens yeah but yeah so what's so what walk us through this process 
what's happening you know as we as we lift the fork full of uh of 
kale we'll say to our to our mouths so this pathway was first discovered in 


the 1970s and so these were cancer biologists trying to understand the etiology of oral 
cancers and at that time it was thought that nitrate would form nitrozamines which would 
intercalate DNA cause mutations and cause cancer and then they recognize that the human body 
actually concentrates intentionally concentrates nitrate in our salivary glands kidneys reabsorb it and concentrate in 
our salivary glands so the body doesn't make mistakes right why would we intentionally reabsorb 
a molecule and then concentrate in our salivary glands because they thought okay that's contributing 


to certain oral cancers well fast forward 30 years and now we recognize that the 
salary glands secrete nitrate so that the bacteria living in the crypts of the tongue 
can metabolize this and these are faculty of anaerobes so when there's no Oxygen around 
they respire on nitrogen in the form of nitrate wow and then this two electron 
reduction forms nitride in our saliva so now when we swallow our own saliva we 
get a burst of nitric oxide and aluminum of the stomach so we've evolved a 


pathway to feed the bacteria that's right in our in our own mouth yeah it's 
a Prebiotic it's an endogenous Prebiotic and it's made to recycle and and reproduce nitric 
oxide on a continual basis so this pathway is dependent upon number one getting enough 
nitrate from the diet number two the presence of the right oral bacteria and number 
three is the presence of stomach acid and so when you use stomach or antacids 
you completely shut down nitric oxide production so under normal conditions if you're healthy if 


you're eating a good balanced diet in moderation you have the right bacteria and you 
have stomach acid production when we consume that meal and it takes 90 minutes from 
if we eat a salad with spinach or any nitrate containing food 90 minutes after 
we consume that we can start seeing secretion of nitrate in our salary glands and 
now for the next six eight ten hours each time we salivate and swallow our 
own saliva we get a burst of nitric oxide and aluminum of the stomach whoa 


and that nitric oxide is produced in the stomach kills things like H pylori the 
ulcer-causing bacteria if you've got some E coli or salmonella or some pathogen on your 
salad or greens it'll kill that it enhances it enhances gastric mucosal blood flows you 
enhance nutrient absorption it prevents ulcers from chronic NSAID use I mean it's a fundamental 
physiological process that we interrupted at our own demise and so now we find that 
there's you know people who have been on antacids for three to five years have 


a 40 higher incidence of heart attack and stroke that's not increased risk that's actual 
events wow in a study up two weeks ago showed that people have been on 
proton pump inhibitors for four years had a 40 increase in dementia wow and Rapid 
onset of Alzheimer's so these drugs really there should be a black box warning on 
them you know these drugs were never approved by the FDA for long-term use they 
were only approved for acute use for uh gastroesophageal reflux but now you can buy 


them over the counter people have been taking them every day for 5 10 15 
years and the consequences are deadly so these are these are very dangerous drugs that 
should not be used I mean antacids they also block B12 absorption yeah without stomach 
acid you can't absorb iron you can't absorb B vitamins you can't absorb magnesium you 
can't absorb iodine can absorb selenium chromium so we become nutrient deficient we interrupt cell 
signaling insulin signaling we become insulin resistant we shut down nitric oxide production we develop 


autoimmune disease without a stomach acid you can't break down proteins into amino acids we 
get peptide fragments absorbed across the gut we develop antibodies against it it's autoimmunity and 
it's all caused by lack of stomach acid production wow is it how do we 
increase I mean say you're not on uh an antacid you don't take an antacid 
regularly are there any ways to boost stomach acid production I guess that's quite a 
bit actually well as a biochemist we had to look at reactions right what is 


the chemical reaction in the parietal cells that make hydrochloric acid and so that that 
chemical reaction is very well elucidated we need iodine we need betaine hydrochloride we need 
zinc and we need B vitamins we need carbon dioxide and the parietal cells make 
carbon dioxide are make hydrochloric acid but if you're on antacids you can absorb iodine 
you can't absorb zinc you can't absorb B vitamins so there's no way that your 
body can make stomach acid if you're on an acid wow because you don't have 


the nutrients to do it to fuel that reaction yeah so then what we have 
to do is we have to supplement the body and the whole kind of Paradigm 
I work on is called restorative physiology whether it's drug development or product development give 
the body what it needs get out of the way the body's a lot smarter 
than we are and the body heals itself so until people get a supplement with 
iodine most people are fishing zinc B vitamins and now the parietal cells have what 


they need to secrete hydrochloric acid and you overcome all the the problems of nutrient 
deficiencies in nitric oxide production I had no idea that iodine iodine's role in stomach 
acid production I mean I was familiar with its role in thyroidism but but when 
you're deficient in iodine I mean you get thyroid dysfunction you develop autoimmune you develop 
a chlorhidary in the stomach and everything that occurs thereafter what are some sources of 
iodine uh kelp seaweed you can't get enough iodine and iodized salt to to fuel 


everything you need to to to convert T4 to T3 active thyroid hormone there's not 
enough iodine and really Americans are deficient in iodine we found that the Japanese diet 
is probably the only population diet out there that's getting enough nitrate from their food 
supply hmm and that's why I supplement with iodine every day 12 and a half 
milligrams because the American diet and the food that we eat in America is basically 
devoid of any iodine yeah I mean unless you're eating a ton of sea vegetables 


that's right or fermented foods or fermented foods yeah I mean I know egg yolks 
contain some yeah but I don't know how much that is wild really good to 
know because I mean people people one sometimes people ask me they have difficulty digesting 
animal products for example some yeah um and uh and the my go-to response my 
sort of like Cookie Cutter default response is usually like you should check out your 
stomach acid you know that's a big for sure you know issue but somebody who 


has for example been on like a low meat diet for some time probably is 
not regularly getting adequate uh amounts of zinc um iodine B vitamins yeah so it's 
like creates this vicious cycle right you don't eat a lot of animal products so 
then the Machinery to digest animal products winds down that's right yeah our body adapts 
what we give it yeah right and so if you hit hit your body with 
something that's not used to seeing it's going to take a while for it to 


adapt so we have to give the body what it needs and heals so I 
tell people my response is take some apple cider vinegar before meal so that's acetic 
acid one tablespoon's enough it'll acidify the Lumen of the stomach now you're acidic and 
you can break down proteins into amino acid you can properly digest food you can 
properly absorb nutrients and it fixes a lot of the problems until your body is 
able to secrete stomach acid on its own wow that's incredible yeah so I tell 


you know nitric oxide is foundational but if you're deficient in stomach acid and iodine 
nitric oxide is foundational but it's not a silver bullet it's not going to fix 
these other problems but I think what we're finding is the body cannot and will 
not heal without nitric oxide production and improving blood flow and reducing inflammation but you 
still have to address the other deficiencies the other problems the other toxins that you 
may be exposed to the other nutrient deficiencies so this is just kind of like 


a the laying the groundwork for the body to heal but the Physicians and the 
practitioners still have to do the investigative work and figure out what exactly is causing 
this particular patient's problems yeah but I mean when you acknowledge that the gut starts 
in the mouth yeah I mean this is like uh this is just really really 
empowering information um one one area where you blew my I mean every you're just 
like you you have all this incredible information to deliver but one area in particular 


that I found fascinating about our first chat was we talked a bit about nitrites 
in processed meat right because processed meat is very controversial some people believe it to 
be like the devil incarnate and others will you know regularly use it for for 
the valuable source of protein that it is right but one I think chemical that 
does seem to um that there seems to be I guess more agreement on than 
not is sodium nitrite which is added as a preservative in processed meats and a 


lot of people tend to like avoid that as a compound but you've argued you've 
published papers suggesting that this isn't actually the dietary Boogeyman that that it's also laid 
out to be it is a cure it's an actual cure it's a curing agent 
to me and it cures the human being of disease okay this is fascinating so 
and and highly controversial yeah well let's go back historically again there's a reason for 
the way things were done if you go back thousands of years long before Refrigeration 


when early humans were hunters and gatherers they killed the Buffalo they killed the deer 
there was no Refrigeration so they had to preserve the meat to get them through 
winter what they found way back when thousands of years ago that they would preserve 
it with sea salt and they thought that the salt was just reducing the moisture 
content of the meat and preventing spoilage and all that well come to find out 
that the sea salt actually had nitrate and nitride some nitride in it it's a 


natural salt potassium nitrate what we call saltpeter today and that led to the curing 
so there you would you would cure the meat there would be bacteria that were 
they were naturally on the meat then those bacteria would reduce nitrate to nitride and 
you would get nitric oxide that binds to the uh the the hemoglobin or the 
myoglobin of muscle and that creates the nitroseal hemochroma pigment that causes the pink color 
and then red meat green so when it preserved the meat it prevents food spoilage 


it prevents bacterial overgrowth prevents foodborne illnesses so it's absolutely essential for ready to eat 
Meats in any processed Meats in fact for decades now the meat industry is trying 
to figure out how do we get rid of nitrite because of the misinformation by 
the media and you cannot live without it I mean if you took nitrite at 
a cured and processed Meats then you would have more Americans dying from salmonella E 
coli botulism than ever before so then the question was then fast forward to the 


50s and 60s in nutritional epidemiology came about right and nutritional epidemiologists take observations from 
populations of people and look at their incidents of certain diseases so they found that 
people who eat um kind of a more process cured meats than others have a 
higher incidence of gastrointestinal cancers but it's colon cancer stomach cancer so these are observations 
and their associations but associations are not causation so there's a series of steps you 
have to go through to establish causation one of those is one there's an observation 


and by the way it's a very small increased risk so relative risk is different 
than absolute risk and it's a statistical kind of a deception can you give us 
an example of that like where so let's say if you if you've got a 
clinical trial and you say that in the control group that was eating cured meat 
let's say a thousand patients and in that thousand patients 990 eight people developed or 
two out of those thousand developed stomach cancer and then in the control group only 


one out of a thousand develop stomach cancer so the absolute risk is 0.001 right 
but if you take the relative risk there's a hundred percent increase in Risk because 
that group went from two that had cancer in the in the cured meat and 
only one in the control and it's a hundred percent 100 it makes headlines right 
otherwise an absolute risk of 0.001 it's within the noise and there's so many other 
confounding factors that's the problem with nutritional epidemiology and relative risk and Reporting this is 


relative risk it's a deception so you have to look at Absolute risk and actually 
what we look at is the number to treat how many people would you need 
to treat or intervene to actually see a reduction in the disease process so that's 
a whole nother subject matter that people don't understand they just read the headlines and 
those are headline grabbing numbers but the next step in that was what's a biologically 
plausible mechanism see that observation to establish causation so in the 50s it was recognized 


that nitrite can form nitrozamines nitrosamines can cause cancer so that was their established biological 
plausible mechanism but then in the 1980s it was recognized that the body actually produces 
nitrate and nitrite this was the first observation and really one of the first observations 
led to discovery of nitric oxide wow so if nitrate and nitrite were cancerous carcinogens 
why would the human body naturally produce them so it starts shooting holes in their 
whole hypothesis and then the other observation was from vegetarians people eat a plant-based diet 


have a 10 time less reduction in risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease hmm so 
if nitrate and nitride and current processed Meats cause cancer vegetarians would have a 10 
time higher rate of cancer than meat eaters in fact we see pretty much the 
opposite wow because 85 percent of the nitrate and nitrite we get from our diet 
comes from green leafy vegetable vegetables right so five percent comes from cured and processed 
meat the other 10 comes from swallowing our own saliva right so you're saying that 


if this is true then we would expect to see dramatically higher rates of these 
kinds of GI cancers in in vegans and vegetarians who are ingesting a lot more 
inorganic nitrate nitrate that's right super interesting yeah so it goes back to the fact 
this may be surprising the media is not always honest with this right shocking we're 
getting a lot of misinformation so this whole story of nitrate nitrite nitrosamines and cancer 
has completely Fallen apart over the past 30 years and it was really the discovery 


of nitric oxide and these compounds actually nitric oxide precursors in effect I've argued since 
for the past 20 years that these are indispensable nutrients that we need nitrate and 
nitrate so I tell and I've consulted for Kraft Oscar Meyer and tried to figure 
out ways how to do this and I go look you shouldn't be running away 
and creating these nitrite free bacon nitrite free hot dogs you should lead with it 
advertising it I'm developing this compound as a drug we're developing these as functional nutrition 


products in fact we've measured this and we published this in 2009 nitrite free bacon 
has five times more nitrite than bacon with sodium nitrite added to it whoa where 
does it come from the celery powder or whatever so here's the game to get 
a no nitrite label you just can't add sodium nitrite so what do they do 
they use celery salt which is high in nitrate and then they put a starter 
culture of a bacteria called staph carnosis on that broth and the bacteria reduce the 


nitrate to nitrite so it's the nitrite that comes from nitrate that cures the meat 
but they didn't add nitrite directly so it's no nitride added meat wow but yet 
now you've got a problem with the variability of the bacterial reduction you still have 
some bacteria present in that food and the shelf life isn't as long so it's 
not a better product it's a more expensive product but it's certainly not a better 
product so I tell people save your money don't spend the extra two dollars a 


pound or whatever it is now to buy no nitrite or organically cured or whatever 
they're calling it now but so what is the process then by which these nitrites 
become nitrosamines in the body like don't when you fry bacon that has sodium nitrite 
in it at high temperatures I'm not a chemist but like isn't there some kind 
of reaction that converts these compounds to nitrosamines yeah here's the chemistry you've got to 
have a certain set of conditions or reactants present for this to occur so there 


and it's not nitrosamines in general so it's only secondary amines right so this is 
a certain type of low molecular weight Amine so primary amines they typically rearrange to 
alcohols they're non-reactive tertiary and coronary amines there's too much steric hindrance for the nitrite 
to react so they don't worry about so the only thing we worry about are 
secondary amines because they're small they're low molecular weight and nitrite can react to form 
nitrogenes and then those nitrosamines and there's only there's a handful of these that are 


known carcinogens and that are mutagen that can cause cancer so I don't dispute the 
fact that nitrosamines are bad so we have to understand is is there endogenous formation 
of nitrogenines in the food we eat so number one you have to have nitrite 
number two you have to have the presence of secondary amines which there typically are 
none in meat products I mean you can add dimethylamine and form nitrozodimethylamine which is 
a huge liver carcinogen but that's not naturally present the other thing once they realize 


this chemistry was that vitamin C in polyphenols and vitamin E are potent Inhibitors of 
nitrogative chemistry so even if you have a secondary amine around and you've got nitrite 
if you've got a certain amount of ascorbic acid or vitamin E or polyphenols it 
completely inhibits 100 inhibits that reaction wow so you don't get any nitrosamine formation and 
I believe it was 1972 the code of Federal Regulation changed to where any nitride 
cured meat product you had to add ascorbic acid to prevent any potential nitrous seed 


of chemistry so now they use erythorbate you'll see erythorbate on bacon and hot dogs 
and that's kind of the we call it an accelerant because it accelerates the one 
electron reduction of nitrate tonight or nitride to nitric oxide which is the actual curing 
agent and it prevents any nitrous native chemistry so now there's no no cause whatsoever 
so you're getting efficient nitric oxide production you're getting efficient curing and really there's no 
residual nitrite left in a cured meat product it's the no that's bound to the 


heme of myoglobin in the meat muscle itself there's hardly any residual nitrate wow sodium 
nitrite actually you're saying is a cure is a cure very interesting so do we 
do we see like a reduction of do we see any of the benefits that 
we would see from a boost in an acute boost of nitric oxide after the 
consumption of processed meat for example with much right now no because there's so little 
in there right it's all reacted in the form of no bound to myoglobin hmm 


the other thing is that you know there's a this is a complex Matrix right 
you get proteins you get fat you get a lot of extracellular material in meat 
muscle so it's a complex food to digest but you don't get any you don't 
get enough nitrite or nitric oxide including process needs to really provide any therapeutic benefit 
and I think that's the reason that we should eat a balanced diet in moderation 
and historically I've written about this you know the societal Norms is you eat your 


salad before you eat your steak why is that well the night the salads providing 
the nitrate so by the time we're digesting the protein from the steak we've 90 
minutes and we've got the nitric oxide being produced we're protecting the vasculature from the 
postprandial inflammation oxidative stress hmm French do it the opposite way right it explains the 
French I don't know but French paradox right yeah actually the French paradox is interesting 
it's not as paradoxical I think as we once thought it was right they eat 


a lot of cheese they eat a lot of um you know they eat a 
lot of saturated fats but saturated fats that are bound to this uh what's called 
the milk fat globule membrane which we're seeing is actually benign from a cardiovascular standpoint 
and so they have like pristine heart health and they smoke a lot yeah yeah 
but they're active Europeans exercise a lot right they walk everywhere yes yeah and so 
it's I think it's you know we have to move we have to exercise we 


in America we go to our restaurant we engorge ourselves we drive home and we 
never walk and we go to bed full and so it's just a it's a 
constant battle there's a lot of um there are a lot of pre-workout supplements on 
the market that claim to boost nitric oxide is there any Merit to those to 
those claims in your typical pre-workout product and for people that do like to lift 
your boy being one of them yeah what is a good way to boost nitric 


oxide pre-workout well again let's go back to 98 when the Nobel Prize was awarded 
that's when nitric oxide really hit kind of Main Street so when 92 was recognized 
as molecule of the Year by Science magazine so it was gaining some momentum in 
terms of the scientific Community but still very little public awareness around it and then 
in 98 a Nobel Prize was awarded then people got excited about it and then 
it was recognized that there's an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase that converts Arginine to 


nitric oxide so these the market was flooded with Arginine based products they called nitric 
oxide the problem with these products are arginine is a semi-essential amino acid right meaning 
that it's produced within the human body through the urea cycle and then we get 
Arginine from our diet from plant proteins animal proteins it's part it's one of the 
amino acids that make up proteins so when we eat a protein diet we get 
Arginine when we have normal uh cycling influx through the urea cycle we make Arginine 


the body is never deficient in arginine so it doesn't make sense to supplement Arginine 
in fact now there's clinical data out showing if you supplement high dose Arginine to 
patients that had a previous heart attack or peripheral disease they get worse and post-in 
for patients that killed more patients than the placebo giving Arginine wow so Arginine should 
not be recommended for patients with endothelial dysfunction so if you if you don't have 
endothelial dysfunction which well-trained athletes have good and ethelial function and there's some evidence out 


there that if you give a certain dose of arginine you can kind of push 
a little bit of nitric oxide and get some out but again arginine is never 
the rate limiting step in nitric oxide production the function of the enzyme that converts 
it to nitric oxide so those products don't work those were those were big for 
probably 15 years and then in 2012 in the London Olympic Games it was recognized 
that people were drinking gallons of beetroot juice right in the London gains and in 


fact the the UK Olympic team won more gold medals won more medals than any 
time in the history of the Olympics and they attributed to drinking their beet juice 
wow so then the market was flooded with beetroot products and now there's hundreds of 
beetroot products out there that are sold as pre-workouts I've tested probably all of them 
99 of them do nothing but turn your pee in your poop Pink and cause 
a lot of anxiety interesting I wonder if it's because you're drinking it and it's 


just like you know write down the gullet it's not those products aren't allowed I 
mean the companies that are marketing these don't understand the science they just think beet 
juice they go out and buy the cheapest dehydrated beetroot product they can and and 
sell it for for 10 15 20 bucks you have to have sufficient nitrate in 
it you have to have the right bacteria and you have to have stomach acid 
and as we've already elucidated most people don't have the right bacteria and most people 


are on antacids so they're not going to get a nitric oxide benefit then in 
fact most of these beet products don't have any detectable nitrate or nitrite in it 
wow damn so there's there's no way they can work wow it's just Creative Marketing 
hmm fascinating so we understood the science and you know back in 2012 I recognized 
this and I developed my own fermented beet powder so what we do is we 
convert it we don't rely on the human body to convert it because everybody would 


have a differential response I'm not interested in bringing the product Market a product that 
only works in a third of the people we have to maintain the Integrity of 
the science and provide safe and effective products that everybody's going to get the same 
effect so we pre-convert our beetroot product into a bioactive nitric oxide so when you 
put it in water we generate nitric oxide gas when you consume it we're liberating 
nitric oxide systemically wow we're not dependent upon the bacteria we're not dependent upon your 


ability to produce stomach acid we generate nitric oxide for you wow and what's the 
product that you gave me that has it's like literally sodium nitrite and vitamin C 
and all this stuff and it's like swallow your saliva after I've been taking a 
pre-workout and so that's our lozenge Okay cool so that was the first product that 
I brought to Market and that came from kind of my first Eureka moment in 
science and in 2007 we published the first paper showing that nitric oxide was a 


hormone right so if you're deficient in other hormones like testosterone or estrogen what do 
you do we have to take it right same thing with nitric oxide if you're 
deficient in nitric oxide production we have to give you nitric oxide and we have 
to fix your body's ability to make it on its own so that was the 
whole basis for me developing a product technology that number one if your body can't 
make nitric oxide we got to do it for you as I mentioned earlier we 


understand the enzymology and the biochemistry that we can fix the enzyme in the lining 
of the blood vessel and now we know how to repopulate these bacteria so I 
developed this orally disintegrating tablet that you put in your mouth it dissolves over five 
minutes you just move it around and we're providing nitric oxide gas so as it's 
dissolving we're generating about 30 parts per million nitric oxide gas whoa It's not giving 
your hoping your body can convert it we can detect it we can quantify it 


we can verify it so and then the other important thing is we recouple the 
NOS enzyme so we see about a 15 Improvement in your body's ability to make 
it four hours after the lozenge and then we're repopulating the good bacteria in your 
mouth wow so it's just the opposite so we're so theoretically people would need less 
and less of my product over time because as we're fixing your body's ability to 
make it the less you need supplemental interesting you said it takes about 90 minutes 


for a high nitrate meal that's right to boost nitric oxide is that the same 
time frame that it takes for one of these lozenges lozenge is immediate wow yeah 
because I've been taking it like literally as I walk into my gym and so 
we can see if we use an ultrasound or carotid artery when you put that 
lozengine in your mouth within 12 seconds we can see your carotid artery dilate whoa 
so it's immediate dissolution it's immediate Vaso activity and you get systemic effects is nitric 


oxide the answer to hypertension to all I mean it's like we're seeing such staggering 
rates of metabolic illness yeah one in two people one in two adults today have 
hypertension yeah two out of three have either pre-hypertension or hypertension wow so yeah I 
think there's there's different causes for hypertension right and you if you look at different 
class of drugs for antihypertensive medication the first kind of I think effective drugs on 
the market were affecting What's called the rain and Angiotensin system so there's ACE inhibitors 


which range intense in converting enzyme inhibitors and that is part of a a kidney 
problem related to hypertension so if you inhibit the conversion of a or Angiotensin converting 
enzyme in the lungs you can prevent the production of a vasoconstrictor right so hypertension 
is really just an imbalance in the vasodilatory versus vasoconstrictive molecules so nitric oxide is 
the primary vasodilator so ACE inhibitors arbs calcium channel antagonist and then diuretics to to 
to correct fluid imbalances wow but there's something called resistant hypertension right and so 50 


of the people that have high blood pressure that are put on prescription medication don't 
respond with better blood pressure so why is that because the root or the cause 
of their hypertension isn't related to their kidneys isn't related to Angiotensin it's not related 
to calcium flux imbalance and it's not related to fluid imbalance what we've published on 
is that hypertension in many cases is a sign of oral dysbiosis oral dysbiosis yeah 
so if you're using mouthwash stop your blood pressure normalizes when you restore the Ecology 


of the oral microbiome your blood pressure normalizes hmm what about uh just drinking alcohol 
people who just you know enjoy imbibing every once in a while does does drinking 
alcohol uh vodka together whatever can that disrupt the oral microbiome no I'm a scotch 
Drinker you are a social Scotch drink in fact I love my Scotch here's the 
issue if if you were to drink alcohol vodka scotch or whatever and you hold 
it in your mouth for 60 or 90 seconds as you would an antiseptic yeah 


I mean maybe because these are 40 right in the actual but I mix mine 
with water so probably what you're what I'm drinking is maybe 10 alcohol well if 
there's anything I remember from 2020 and the whole like coveted hygiene theater it's that 
you want your the alcohol percentage has to be 60 or higher for it to 
be uh antiseptic or something and did I just butcher that yeah no I think 
that's that's probably right so what we're drinking even if we were to hold the 


alcohol in the mouth for 30 seconds like we would a mouthwash it's probably you're 
not probably not going to get effective killing hmm um but you know during covid 
everything they were telling us to do was basically making people more susceptible to covet 
infection crazy like the the antiseptic uh the hand sanitizers and and using I mean 
that basically kills the microbiome there were people telling you they used mouthwash and antacids 
and all that I mean that you're making the patient more susceptible to covet infection 


hmm Wild yeah that was a that was a crazy time and there was just 
that review published in um it was like exercise physiology one of these journals where 
they said that exercise literally is like the ultimate most ideal first-line defense for sure 
look when I feel like my body's getting weak and I feel like I've got 
an onset of an illness coming first thing I do the last thing I want 
to do is go to the gym but the first thing I do is go 


to the gym wow and I exercise I do 30 minutes of cardio and then 
I'll go sit in a sauna for 30 minutes and I haven't been sick in 
more than 20 years Sonic does Boost nitric oxide does it not yes certain I 
mean red light there's certain wavelengths of light that will stimulate nitric oxide production red 
light so I have a red light device is that that's boosting nitric oxide when 
I use that so what's happening is there's what we call and we published on 


this I believe in 2001 their photo laboss stores of nitric oxide that you can 
activate so when nitric oxide is produced it has certain cellular targets it combine the 
metals they can bind the cysteine files and so infrared light will actually liberate nitric 
oxide bound to metals and then if you look at infrared or ultraviolet light it'll 
cleave inno-bound assisting thighs on proteins so when you get exposure to sunlight you're getting 
both UV you're getting infrared and you're releasing nitric oxide wow but the problem is 


if you're if if you're deficient in nitric oxide you're deficient in these photo label 
stores of nitric oxide so if you've got a sick patient who can't make nitric 
oxide red light therapies there's no nitric oxide to release hmm so what we do 
is we would we try to titrate up the nitric oxide so either take our 
laws into our beet powder and then exposed to red light therapy now we're going 
to potentiate the effects of red light therapy you're going to potentiate the effects the 


blood pressure lowering effects of sunlight or exposure to different light sources wow but if 
you're if your oral microbiome is intact and healthy and you regularly eat dark leafy 
greens then there is a synergistic effect absolutely that you get in terms of nitric 
oxide synthesis with red light exposure sun exposure Etc yeah you need nitrate you need 
bacteria and you need stomach acid wow without either three if one of those is 
missing you don't get the effects do you think the carnivore diet is a terrible 


idea no like I think different people respond to different diets I'm not a big 
fan of extreme diets perpetually I think you can make some changes in human physiology 
metabolism by these drastic changes so I'm not a big fan of a straight vegan 
diet I'm not a big straight big fan of a carnivore diet forever so I 
think you can you can do intermittent changes in this and see the benefits but 
from what I know about science and Agronomy and nutrient assimilation and vegetables and nutrient 


assimilation in animal proteins is we get the many nutrients and minerals that we need 
from a balanced diet from a diverse diet I think that's how we as humans 
have evolved we get our nutrients from many different dietary sources well it's like they're 
not getting these inorganic nitrates there's really not I mean I think we put we 
published on this in 2015 there's very little residual nitrate or nitride in animal meats 
and meat products and so these the animals we eat are vegetarians right yeah so 


they're a simplest they're plant-based so they're assimilating the nitrate from the grass and the 
vegetables they're eating into their own tissue muscle tissue so even non-cured meat non-processed Meats 
like a rib eye steak or things that's unprocessed has some nitrate and nitrate it's 
very little wow but it's there and it's detectable that's rib eyes are my love 
language yeah mine too yeah love them there's also correct me if I'm wrong there's 
a role for some of these carna nutrients like CoQ10 right in terms of recycling 


right nitric oxide so it can make a little go a longer way hypothetically well 
there are a number of there's the human body is redundant by Nature right so 
there's enormous redundancy in the human body in fact if there was only one way 
to make nitric oxide then probably humans would become extinct so there has to be 
numerous ways to make this critical molecule and there are different ways to recycle it 
and extend its biological Half-Life that's kind of what we've harnessed in our therapeutic program 


in our product development so once nitric oxide is produced it's gone in less than 
a second in fact the half-life of nitric oxide in the human body is two 
milliseconds whoa so but we can extend the biological half-life of this by understanding the 
metabolic kind of hierarchy of nitric oxide where does it go what does it become 
and what does it do and so if we can capture that in form of 
a product technology or therapeutic then we can extend the biological Half-Life from two milliseconds 


out to tens of minutes and hours we can do this through giving sulfur compounds 
like glutathione polyphenols you mentioned CoQ10 CoQ10 is extremely important for mitochondrial function nitric oxide 
is what controls and regulates mitochondrial ATP production maintains the electrical potential across the mitochondria 
so it can generate ATP and produce less superoxide and oxidative stress and nitric oxide 
is what controls mitochondrial biogenesis so again we can induce all these Pathways but if 
you don't have enough CoQ10 and all these mitochondrial cofactors then the mitochondria are going 


to be dysfunctional so in that case it's not a nitric oxide deficiency it's a 
mitochondrial issue so again we have to give the body what it needs the body 
incorporates what it needs and does its job Beyond cardiovascular health are there other areas 
of well-being that nitric oxide influences like immune function for example inflammation so we learned 
a lot there's a rich literature on nitric oxide and immune function in fact one 
of the first discoveries of nitric oxide was in macrophages in this whole reaction of 


arginine to nitric oxide to nitrate this is back in probably mid 80s so our 
immune cells make nitric oxide and the whole purpose of this is when we're exposed 
to a pathogen whether it's a virus or bacteria then our immune cells recognize that 
cardiovascular system mobilizes an immune response so we get the immune cells to the side 
of attachment infection and then these immune cells surround that and generate a ton of 
nitric oxide wow and this nitric oxide binds to the iron sulfur centers of bacteria 


shuts down the respiration kills the bacteria and it prevents the virus from replicating so 
even if we're exposed to a virus if our immune system is strong it generates 
nitric oxide we don't get sick from the virus wow and this was what we 
recognized in probably March of 2020 in covet that the people that were getting sick 
and dying from covid were the people couldn't make nitric oxide wow so who was 
this to the elderly people with a prior heart attack diabetes African-Americans uh people with 


pulmonary hypertension or smoked these were the people that if they got exposed to covid 
there was a very predictable sequence of events within three days they were sick within 
four to five days they were hospitalized from low blood oxygen saturation five to six 
days later they were put on mechanical vent ten days later they were dead I 
mean this was very predictable so that's what initiated us to start our drug trial 
for coven so we had a nitric oxide drug and phase three clinical trials for 


coven wow we filed our investigationally drug application in June FDA approved it in July 
we started enroll in patients in December of 2020. and we were making people better 
but at that time Cove had changed right the hospitals weren't overrun with patients these 
new restraints that evolved were less virulent and people weren't going to the hospital so 
we our our child design was to reduce hospitalization by 20 so we were enrolling 
high-risk patients and seeing if we could create an early treatment to keep them out 


of the hospital keep their blood oxygen saturation up prevent virus replicating and we did 
this but the problem was in the patients that we were enrolling no one was 
going to the hospital even the ones on the placebo because they were getting the 
milder form of the disease but here's what we've learned and I'm probably the best 
example during since March of 2020 I've been on an airplane probably every week for 
the past four years and at one time we had 26 coveted clinics around the 


U.S so we would go in enroll patients I didn't wear a mask I was 
almost thrown off airplanes for not wearing a mass I didn't get the jab I've 
never had covet wow in fact I haven't had been sick from any infection or 
sickness since 2001 when I got the flu vaccine when I was at Boston Medical 
Center damn so it's not that I I'm not exposed to these pathogens I'm exposed 
every day yeah but my immune system is robust I make a lot of nitric 


oxide and if I'm exposed we shut it down at the source of infection we 
prevent it from replicating and propagating and making people sick wow fascinating and what about 
just for I mean a lot of people today struggle from generalized low-grade chronic inflammation 
look at so mechanistically what I'd in terms of inflammation it's very well defined in 
science most people just think well you're inflamed right they see it as the silent 
killer which has been known yeah for many decades so there's different markers of inflammation 


one is high sensitivity C-reactive protein that you can measure in the blood in fact 
one of my patents in our nitric oxide is a method of reducing C-reactive protein 
wow so nitric Ox suddenly published on this in 2009 that nitric oxide reduces the 
inflammatory response reduces C-reactive protein and when we look at inflammation the earliest stages of 
inflammation is called microvascular inflammation when the blood vessels become like velcro right platelet stick 
monocytes neutrophils stick and then they infiltrate into the intimum they develop oxidative stress immune 


dysfunction you get plaque development the plaque ruptures heart attack and stroke so the sequence 
of events physiologically are very well defined if you can inhibit that early microvascular inflammation 
you can inhibit the onset and progression of cardiovascular disease wow and that's what nitric 
oxide does that's the reason it's so effective in in covid you know whether you 
give inhaled nitric oxide and there are a number of clinical studies that nitric oxide 
prevents the the upregulation of adhesion molecules so the spike protein binds to the ace 


receptor if your nitric oxide deficient you get an upregulation of the ace receptor so 
there's more targets for the spike protein to bind to that causes further vascular inflammation 
platelets start sticking get an elevation and D-dimer micro clots so everything we know about 
covid and long covid and the systemic disease of covid can be traced back to 
lack of nitric oxide Wild is there a risk from bumping your nitric oxide too 
high yes as with everything it's dose dependent yeah too little no is bad too 


much can be bad hmm there's only two signs of toxicity one is low blood 
pressure if you take too much nitric oxide you get systemic vasodilation and you'll lose 
perfusion pressure so is it safe to say that somebody with for example pots you 
know I guess probably has two could they potentially have too much nitric oxide I 
think that's an autonomic disorder not necessarily related to the overproduction of nitric oxide it's 
an autonomic nervous system disorder where they lose the ability to control you know blood 


pressure upon sitting and standing yeah it's an autonomic nervous system issue the only time 
you see and again if you go back 20 years people thought that when you 
get sepsis right when you get systemic infection and septicemia that the reason people die 
from sepsis is hypoperfusion of organs so it was thought that when you have an 
active infection the immune cells are generating too much nitric oxide you're getting systemic vasodilation 
leading to loss of perfusion pressure and organ failure and death so in 1990 I 


think it was 1998 they developed a clinical trial to give a nitric oxide inhibitor 
to septic patients with very good reasoning right if you're making too much nitric oxide 
if you inhibit it can you prevent the loss of blood pressure and save people's 
lives well a very unpredictable occurrence happened that when they gave a NOS inhibitor it 
killed more people than the placebo so that tell the scientific medical community that the 
death from sepsis and septicemia is not due to an overproduction of nitric oxide so 


now we struggle with trying to find kind of a natural physiological condition where there's 
overproduction of nitric oxide and I don't think there that exists but certainly you can 
take too much no and you'll lose the loss of your blood pressure will drop 
or you develop what's called met hemoglobinemia so you'll oxidize the iron in hemoglobin of 
the red blood cells and then you lose the oxygen carrying capacity of the red 
blood cell and it becomes cyanotic she'll get blue around the lips you'll lose color 


but that's a I mean that's a whopping though should need I know it's typically 
hundreds of thousand times higher than what you would ever get from a diet or 
from any product yeah and you will lose you will develop low blood pressure long 
before you develop any met hemoglobin formation hmm I mean most of the people today 
like the the problem facing most westerners is hypertension it's high blood pressure not the 
uh not the inverse well there are people with low blood pressure and that's typically 


a thyroid issue hypothyroidism causes low blood pressure so then you've got to fix and 
the and the good thing about our product technology and we tested this early on 
is if you have low blood pressure and you take one of our lozenges does 
it further reduce your blood pressure causing syncope and and lightheadedness and the answer is 
no so my blood pressure is typically you know 115 over 72 at any given 
time and I take a loss and doesn't change it we've done 24-hour ambulatory blood 


pressure and it doesn't if you have normal or low blood pressure it doesn't change 
your blood pressure if you have high blood pressure it'll normalize it so that's one 
of the remarkable things about delivering nitric oxide at the right dose over the right 
amount of time it's it's regulatory by Nature hmm man-to-man you take one of those 
lozenges before sex what happens well we improve profusion right I mean we're leading to 
not only dilating the resistance arteries but opening up the microcirculation and so in the 


sex organs it's a spongy tissue right with a lot of small blood vessels so 
when we can improve the perfusion and open up those micro circulation and small blood 
vessels we get better perfusion better engorgement better erections have you are there clinical trials 
I mean does it like how would its how would it work in comparison to 
a drug like Viagra well again let's go back and talk about how Viagra was 
discovered and put into clinical practice these drugs early on were developed for patients with 


pulmonary hypertension and for ischemic heart disease so the whole rationale is so these drugs 
are called phosphodestrase inhibitors nitric oxide once it's produced causes a increase in a second 
messenger called cyclic GMP and Viagra prevents the breakdown of the second messenger so now 
like I said nitric oxide turns the switch on and Viagra keeps it on and 
that's the reason you're worn against a four-hour erection and headaches and loss of vision 
and all these side effects yeah but 50 of the men that are given Viagra 


don't respond with better erections interesting so it's been on the market for 25 years 
multi-billion dollar a year drug that only works in less than 50 of the men 
I thought it like worked in everybody no no 50 efficacy in men with Ed 
or symptoms of BPH benign prostate hypertrophy so mechanistically we understand why that is because 
you need nitric oxide for Viagra to work and if you can't make nitric oxide 
there's no increase in cyclic GMP so there's no substrate for these drugs to work 


on got it and we did a clinical trial years ago where we took non-responders 
to pd5 inhibition therapy we were using I think patients who were on five milligram 
CLS once daily free their erectile dysfunction or BPH and those that were non-responsive we 
actually made them responsive by giving them the nitric oxide damn so you take one 
of your lozenges and a Viagra and you're just ready to party yeah be careful 
though damn you can overdo it yeah so the whole point is if you if 


you understand mechanistically what causes vasodilation what causes Improvement in sexual function and erections then 
you get to the root cause of it you don't need phosphodestrase Inhibitors to improve 
sexual function what we're finding is if you just improve nitric oxide production all the 
down same signaling aspects of that take care of itself you generate nitric oxide you 
activate guanal cyclase you increase cyclic GNP you get vasodilation you get an erection it's 
that simple and as you mentioned earlier in the episode benefits women as well right 


yeah look they need engorgement in in erections as well it's a clitoral erection instead 
of a penile erection but it's the exact same the anatomy is a little bit 
different the physiology is exactly the same yeah damn more nitric oxide for everybody I 
feel like the world will be a better place we'd all be happier well we're 
working on that we're working on it thanks to you we're going to educate more 
people on the importance yeah man my mind is always blown whenever I get to 


sit down and chat with you and I felt I failed to mention this earlier 
in the episode but I actually quote you in my third book genius kitchen as 
well oh in the section about like mouthwash yeah yeah now that's always the aha 
moment for people I mean because people have good intents I think you know they 
see the adverts on TV they go to their dentist and they think well I 
need to have clean breath fresh smelling breath but they don't understand the collateral damage 


causing yeah it's like dropping an atomic bomb in your mouth you're killing the bad 
guys but you're killing the good guys too and not only that but the good 
guys probably police the bad guys too that's exactly right right to promote good breath 
like it's the whole ecology there are different communities of bacteria and the gingival tissue 
on the tongue their biofilms different layers and so as long as you have a 
good healthy diverse oral microbiome the good guys keep the bad guys at Bay when 


you disrupt that you cause chaos then the bad guys take over and now the 
inmates are leading the Asylum damn all right so let's just do like a recap 
because I feel like there's so much incredible information here and people should definitely go 
and you know follow you on the socials and check out your products and everything 
because I mean this is like really groundbreaking groundbreaking science that you're sharing but for 
those interested in optimizing their nitric oxide levels let's just in a sort of Cliff 


Notes format recap what actionable steps or advice would you recommend you got to do 
two things it's only very simple stop doing the things that disrupted start doing the 
things that promote it so what is that stop using mouthwash I mean the evidence 
is abundantly clear I mean for me everything's about risk benefit what are the risks 
versus the benefits mouthwash there's really no benefits the risk high blood pressure loss of 
the protective benefits of exercise and probably Ed and the whole sequel of things that 


happen with nitric oxide deficiency you have to get rid of fluoride by fluoride free 
toothpaste get rid of fluoride in your drinking water and your home health system or 
home water system and then if you're using an acid you have to stop so 
those are three biggies fluoride mouthwashing and acids you have to completely get off this 
because that's inhibiting the body's ability to make nitric oxide on its own and then 
there's no need for product technology unless you're not doing the other so if you 


stop doing those three things and you just get 20 30 minutes of physical exercise 
a day it can be a brisk walk then more green leafy vegetables or a 
nitrate Source I I recommend a balanced diet in moderation and then sunlight or the 
red light therapy or you know you get broad spectrum full spectrum from sunlight so 
I'm a big fan of you know just sitting 20 30 minutes out in the 
sun today hmm and then when all else fails then we have products that do 


it for you love it super useful with regard to Oral Care um are you 
a fan of hydroxyapatite like some of these fluoride replacements I think there's a there's 
a spot for that again and everybody's different right so hydroxyapatite is kind of like 
a substrate that helps build strong teeth and bones um there are a lot of 
there are a lot of things we don't know still uh you know people ask 
me all the time about oil pulling essential oils different oral hygienic practices tongue scraping 


you know in 2019 we published that if you tongue scraped that the people who 
did tongue scraping had a seem to have a higher diversity of the oral microbiome 
which seemed to be a good thing and they had better blood pressure management but 
if you tongue scraped and use mouthwash those were the people we saw the highest 
increase in blood pressure on WOW so I think tongue scraping alone is probably good 
we just don't know about things like hydroxyapatite how they're affecting the the microbiome we 


don't have any data on things like essential oils or oil pooling but I think 
what as long as they're not antiseptic then it's probably going to be fine you 
have to support the ecology or the oral microbiome and let these bugs do their 
job hmm great advice Nathan Brian for president not yet do you got other work 
to do I know you do you do yeah there's a lot of work that 
needs to be done but fascinating stuff man thank you so much for coming back
